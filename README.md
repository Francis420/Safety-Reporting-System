The Neighborhood Safety Reporting System is a web-based application designed to enable residents to report safety concerns and incidents in their neighborhoods. This system aims to promote safer communities by allowing residents to submit reports of unsafe conditions, such as crimes, hazards, or suspicious activities.

Current methods of reporting safety issues, such as through phone calls or in-person visits to local authorities, can be slow, inefficient, and often inaccessible. The proposed system would provide an easy-to-use, online platform where residents can quickly report issues and track the resolution status of their submissions.

By using Django as the backend framework and MySQL for data storage, this web-based system will store reports securely, allow for easy tracking and management by authorities, and provide insights into safety trends within neighborhoods.
